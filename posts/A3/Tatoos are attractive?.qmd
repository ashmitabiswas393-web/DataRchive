# Are tattoos attractive?

Tattoos or taboos? Analyzing the perception about tattoos.

![](images/clipboard-1622646561.png)

## About the Data

This data set is derived from the peasants of Srishti Manipal Institute to analyse the proportions of non-tattooed people who find tattoos attractive✨.

## Data Dictionary

**Qualitative Variables**

:   **Name:** Name of the student

:   **Gender:** Gender of the student where; M = Male, F = Female

:   **Tattoos_Attractive:** Students' perception about tattoos being attractive or not

## Hypothesis

-   Being in an art and design college, will the proportion of people finding tattoos attractive be more or be the same i.e. 1:1?

-   Does gender play a role in the way tattoos are perceived as?

### Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false

library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggformula)
library(mosaic)
library(skimr)
library(visdat) 
library(naniar)
library(janitor)
library(tinytable)
library(DT)
library(crosstable)
library(geofacet)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Reading the Data

```{r}

tattoo_data <- read_csv("~/Documents/R_work/Class work 2/ClassWork2/posts/A3/Datasets for A3/1-tattoo_attraction.csv") %>% 
janitor::clean_names(case = "snake")
tattoo_data
```

### Checking for missing data

```{r}
tattoo_data %>%
  visdat::vis_miss()
```

Seems like there is no missing data! (Did i collect this data? Hmm)

### Munging the data

```{r}
tattoo_data_mod1 <- tattoo_data %>% 
mutate(gender = as.factor(gender),
tattoo_attractive = as.factor(tattoo_attractive))
```

## Examining the Data

### Taking a glimpse 👀 of the Data

```{r}
glimpse(tattoo_data_mod1)
```

There are a total of *40 entries*

### Counting gender

```{r}
tattoo_data_mod1 %>% 
  dplyr::count(gender) %>%
  tt()
```

#### Observation

-   There is an equal number of male and female representation

### Counting tattoo attractive perception

```{r}
tattoo_data_mod1 %>% 
  dplyr::count(tattoo_attractive) %>% 
  tt()
```

```{r}
tattoo_data_mod1 %>% 
gf_bar(~tattoo_attractive, fill = "navy") %>% 
gf_labs(title = "Do students find tattoos attractive?",
       x = "Are tattoos attractive?",
       y = "Number of students")
```

#### Observation

-   We can see that exactly *75%* of the students *find tattoos attractive*
-   This maybe due to the influence of the environment where tattoos are looked as a normal mark to have and/or younger generation embracing tattoos.

### Does gender play a role in this?

```{r}
tattoo_data_mod1 %>% 
gf_bar(~tattoo_attractive, fill = ~gender, position = "dodge") %>% 
gf_labs(title = "Tattoo Attractiveness by Gender",
       x = "Are tattoos attractive?",
       y = "Number of students")

```

```{r}
tattoo_data_mod1 %>% 
gf_bar(~tattoo_attractive, fill = ~gender, position = "fill") %>% 
gf_labs(title = "Tattoo Attractiveness by Gender",
       x = "Are tattoos attractive?",
       y = "Number of students")

```

```{r}
tattoo_data_mod1 %>% 
    count(across(c("gender", "tattoo_attractive"))) %>%
  tt()
```

#### Observation

-   There is an equal distribution amongst the 2 genders, which leads to the belief that there might be no gender bias in the perception of tattoos being attractive to the 2 genders.

```{r}
vcd::structable(gender ~ tattoo_attractive, data = tattoo_data_mod1) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  addmargins() %>%
  as_tibble(rownames = "gender")

vcd::structable(gender ~ tattoo_attractive, data = tattoo_data_mod1) %>%
  vcd::mosaic(shade = TRUE, legend = TRUE,
              main = "Tattoo Attractiveness by Gender")
```

### Observation

-   The p value = 1 between Gender and Tattoo attractiveness.

-   This means there is no gender bias and the variables are independent / have no correlation to on another.

## Inference

-
