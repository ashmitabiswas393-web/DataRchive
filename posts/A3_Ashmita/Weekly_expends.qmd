# Weekly expenditure

Are Srishti students really Money-pal? 💸

![](images/clipboard-1362529375.png)

## About the Data

This data is collected from Srishti Manipal Institute students, measuring weekly expenditure variations and exploring demographic influences on spending patterns.

## Data Dictionary

**Qualitative variables**

:   **Name:** Name of the student (aka. peasant)

:   **Gender:** Gender of the students categorized as 'Male' & 'Female'

**Quantitative variables**

:   **Total_Expenditure_Last_Week:** Total amount of money spent in the last week by the student

## Hypothesis

-   Do Srishti students exhibit higher than average weekly expenditure compared to normative spending benchmark (Rs. 2000)?

**Something more to look for**

-   Is there a difference in spending behaviour among genders?

### Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false

library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggformula)
library(mosaic)
library(skimr)
library(visdat) 
library(naniar)
library(janitor)
library(tinytable)
library(DT)
library(crosstable)
library(geofacet)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
```

### Inspecting the Data

```{r}

weekly_expends_data <- read_csv("~/Documents/R_work/DataRchive/posts/A3_Ashmita/Datasets/4-weekly_expenditure.csv") %>%
janitor::clean_names(case = "snake")
weekly_expends_data
```

### Checking for missing data

```{r}
weekly_expends_data %>%
  visdat::vis_miss()
```

```{r}
weekly_expends_data %>%
  visdat::vis_dat()
```

Removing the unfilled columns

```{r}
weekly_expends_mod1 <- weekly_expends_data%>% 
select(name, gender, total_expenditure_last_week)

weekly_expends_mod1
```

### Munging the Data

```{r}
weekly_expends_mod2 <- weekly_expends_mod1 %>% 
  mutate(gender = as.factor(gender))

weekly_expends_mod2
```

## Examining the Data

Summarizing in a table

```{r}
summary(weekly_expends_mod2)
```

#### Observation

-   We can see that there is an equal (50%) representation of male and female, thus eliminating any gender bias in the data collection.

-   The average spending of these peasants in a week is Rs. 4833

-   Spending varies dramatically from lowest record being Rs. 365 to highest being Rs. 50,000 per week

-   25% of these students spend under Rs. 1,204 weekly and top 25% spend over Rs. 4,475.

### What is the spending behaviour

```{r}
weekly_expends_mod2 %>%
  gf_boxplot(~total_expenditure_last_week, orientation = "y", fill="darkgreen") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Weekly Spending Distribution",
    x = "Total Expenditure (in Rs.)", 
    y = "Students"
  )
```

#### Observation

-   Normal range of spendings are till Rs. 5000 a week with outliers spending around Rs. 15,000, Rs. 23,000 and Rs. 50,000 (extremely insane)

-   This creates a highly right-skewed distribution, where a small number of students spend dramatically more than the rest.

-   This spikes in the spending might be a cause of different student responsible for different financial payments

### Visualizing spending of each student

```{r}
weekly_expends_mod2 %>%
  arrange(total_expenditure_last_week) %>%
  mutate(name = fct_inorder(name)) %>%
  gf_col(total_expenditure_last_week ~ name, fill = ~gender) %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Weekly Spending",
    x = "Student",
    y = "Total Expenditure (in Rs.)"
  ) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))
```

#### Observation

-   Most students cluster at **low to moderate spending levels (under Rs. 5,000)**. However, a small number of students stand out with extremely high spending, reaching up to Rs. 50,000 per week.

-   Both genders appear across the spending range, though the **very high spenders at the extreme end are predominantly male**.

-   **Average spending looks similar across genders**, aligning with earlier summary statistics.

-   But **male students are more represented in the high-expenditure outliers**, suggesting **greater variability** in male spending behavior, not necessarily higher average spending (but since the data set samples 40 students, we can't make a concrete conclusion)

### How do different gender spend differently?

```{r}
weekly_expends_mod2 %>%
  gf_boxplot(log10(total_expenditure_last_week) ~ gender, fill = ~gender, orientation = "x") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Weekly Spending Distribution by Gender",
    x = "Gender", 
    y = "Total Expenditure (in Rs.)"
  )
```

#### Observation

-   The **median spending** for male students is **slightly higher** than that of female students.

-   Both groups show **similar lower bounds**, but the **upper range** of spending is **higher for males**, indicating **greater variability**.

-   There are **visible outliers**, particularly among males, suggesting a **few male students spend significantly more** than the typical weekly amount.

-   Female spending is more **consistent and tightly clustered**, whereas male spending is **more spread out**.

### Gender wise spending in Density graph

```{r}
weekly_expends_mod2 %>%
  gf_dens(~total_expenditure_last_week, colour = ~gender, fill = ~gender, size = 1, alpha = 0.5) %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Spending Density by Gender",
    x = "Total Expenditure",
    y = "Density"
  )
```

#### Observation

-   Both male and female spending distributions show a s**teep peak at lower expenditure levels**, meaning most students spend modestly

-   The female curve peaks higher, more in the lower ranges indicating that female spending is more concentrated around this lower spending range.

-   The male density curve is more spread out with longer tails, showing that while many males also spend moderately, there are more high-spending male outliers

```{r}
weekly_expends_mod2 %>%
  dplyr::group_by(gender) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mean_spending = mean(total_expenditure_last_week)) %>%
  gf_col(mean_spending ~ gender, fill = ~gender) %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Average weekly spending by Gender",
    x = "Gender",
    y = "Mean Expenditure (in Rs.)"
  )

```

#### Observation

-   On average, **male students spend significantly more** than female students. While females tend to cluster around \~Rs. 2,500 per week, **male spending averages above Rs. 6,500**, indicating a much higher weekly outflow.

## Conclusion from EDA

-   Most Srishti students spend **modest amounts** weekly (around **Rs. 1,000 – Rs. 4,500**), but a few students show **very high expenditures**, creating large outliers in the data. This indicates **big differences in lifestyle or financial responsibilities** among students.

-   On average, **male students spend more than female students**, and their spending also varies more widely. Overall, the data shows that student spending behavior is **diverse**, with no single “typical” spending pattern across the group.

## Inference

**Null Hypothesis:** The true average weekly spending of Srishti students is **Rs. 2000**. There is no evidence that they spend more or less than this benchmark.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The true average weekly spending of Srishti students is **different from Rs. 2000**.

### Performing Wilcoxon Test since the data is not normally distributed

```{r}
weekly_expends_mod2 <- function(x) {
  sign(x) * total_expenditure_last_week(abs(x))
}
```

```{r}
t2 <- wilcox.test(weekly_expends_mod1$total_expenditure_last_week,
                  mu = 2000,
                  alternative = "two.sided",
                  conf.int = TRUE,
                  conf.level = 0.95) %>%
  broom::tidy()

t2
```

#### Conclusion

-   The **p-value = 0.045**, which is **less than 0.05**.

-   Therefore, we **reject the null hypothesis** that the median weekly spending is ₹2000.

-   The **estimated median weekly expenditure is ₹2875**, and the confidence interval **does not include ₹2000**, further supporting the conclusion.

## Final interpretation

-   Srishti students **do spend significantly more than ₹2000 per week** on average. This suggests that their weekly expenditure is **substantially higher** than the chosen baseline, indicating a relatively **high-spend lifestyle** among students.

-   Both male and female students show **similar median and distribution patterns**, while some males had extreme expenditure which indicates that lifestyle and personal budgeting habits are more influential than gender.

-   Overall, the spending trend reflects a student culture shaped by **convenience purchases, social activities, and city-based living costs**, suggesting that daily expenditure is about about shared environment and lifestyle.
