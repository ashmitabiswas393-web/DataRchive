# Are Dads weird?

Paternal weirdness rating is...weird.

## About the Data

This data set is derived from the peasants of Manipal University where we wanted to understand if SMI dads embarrass their kids more than MIT dads.

## Data Dictionary

Qualitative Variables

:   **gender:** Gender of the student where, M = Male, F = Female, NB = Non Binary

:   **college:** Institute within Manipal University, the peasant belongs to.

:   **is_dad_weird:** Is the dad perceived as weird or not, categorized by 'Yes' and 'No'

:   **name:** Name of the student (aka. peasant)

## Hypothesis

-   Do SMI students find their dads to be weirder as compared to MIT?

    **Something interesting to look for:**

-   Is there a bias in gender when it comes do dad weirdness perception of dads?

### Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false

library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggformula)
library(mosaic)
library(skimr)
library(visdat) 
library(naniar)
library(janitor)
library(tinytable)
library(DT)
library(crosstable)
library(geofacet)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(vcd)
library(vcdExtra)
```

### Inspecting the Data

```{r}

weird_dad_data <- read_csv("~/Documents/R_work/DataRchive/posts/A3_Ashmita/Datasets/3-weird_dads.csv") %>%
janitor::clean_names(case = "snake")
weird_dad_data
```

### Reading the Data

```{r}

dad_weird_data <- read_csv("~/Documents/R_work/DataRchive/posts/A3_Ashmita/Datasets/3-weird_dads.csv") %>%
janitor::clean_names(case = "snake")
dad_weird_data
```

### Checking for missing data

```{r}
dad_weird_data %>%
  visdat::vis_miss()
```

```{r}
dad_weird_data %>%
  visdat::vis_dat()
```

Seems like some peasants were boggled by the question 'Is your dad weird?' and couldn't comprehend to answer. Hence removing the entries for these confused souls

```{r}
dad_weird_mod1 <- dad_weird_data %>% 
  naniar::replace_with_na_all(condition = ~ .x %in% common_na_strings) %>% 
drop_na()
dad_weird_mod1
```

One entry was dropped from the data set.

### Munging the Data

Factoring 'gender' and 'is_dad_weird'

```{r}
dad_weird_mod2 <- dad_weird_mod1 %>% 
mutate(gender = as.factor(gender),
       is_dad_weird = as.factor(is_dad_weird))
```

### Examining the Data

Taking a glimpse of the Data

```{r}
glimpse(dad_weird_mod2)
```

### Counting gender

```{r}
dad_weird_mod2 %>% 
  dplyr::count(gender) %>%
  tt()
```

```{r}
dad_weird_mod2 %>% 
  gf_bar(~gender, fill = "purple") %>% 
gf_labs(title = "Gender distribution",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Count")

```

#### Observation

-   There is nearly equal representation between Female (32) and Male (31) students
-   Since the representation of Non-binary is one and not significant, for gender related tests, it will be excluded.

### Counting representation for each college

```{r}
dad_weird_mod2 %>% 
  dplyr::count(college) %>%
  tt()
```

```{r}
dad_weird_mod2 %>%
  gf_bar(~college, fill = "dodgerblue") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "College representation",
    x = "Colleges",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

#### Observation

-   Both colleges are nearly equally represented, hence there is no bias in the data collection

-   The 64-student sample is perfect for college-wise analysis with minimal sampling bias

### Counting is_dad_weird

```{r}
dad_weird_mod2 %>% 
  dplyr::count(is_dad_weird) %>%
  tt()
```

```{r}
dad_weird_mod2 %>%
  gf_bar(~is_dad_weird, fill = "skyblue") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Do students think their Dads are weird?",
    x = "Is Dad weird?",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

#### Observation

-   Huh! Most students are NOT finding their dad weird, now that's weird.
-   **Strong 3:1 Ratio**: "Normal" dads significantly outnumber "weird" dads

### How Dad weirdness relates to Gender

```{r}
dad_weird_mod2 %>%
  filter(gender != "NB") %>%
  count(across(c("gender", "is_dad_weird"))) %>%
  tt()
```

```{r}
dad_weird_mod2 %>%
   filter(gender != "NB") %>%
  gf_bar(~gender, fill = ~is_dad_weird, position = "fill") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Gender vs. Dad Weirdness",
    subtitle = "Do sons and daughters rate dad-cringe differently?",
    x = "Gender",
    y = "Proportion"
  )
```

### Observation

-   Nearly identical gender patterns

-   23 Females and 24 Males say that there Dads are not weird

### Dad weirdness for colleges

```{r}
dad_weird_mod2 %>%
  filter(gender != "NB") %>%
  count(across(c("college", "is_dad_weird"))) %>%
  tt()
```

Visualizing in a Dodge and Proportion Bar graph

```{r}
dad_weird_mod2 %>%
  gf_bar(~college, fill = ~is_dad_weird, position = "dodge") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Dad Weirdness for SMI & MIT",
    x = "College",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

**Let's check their proportions**

```{r}
dad_weird_mod2 %>%
  gf_bar(~college, fill = ~is_dad_weird, position = "fill") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Dad Weirdness: SMI vs MIT Showdown",
    x = "College",
    y = "Proportion",
    fill = "Weird Dad?"
  )
```

#### Observation

-   There seems to be a distinct divide among colleges

-   **MIT Students**: 28 of 32 say dads are NOT weird (too good to be true?)

-   **SMI Students**: 19 of 31 say dads are NOT weird (here's the weirdness!)

-   SMI students are **3x more likely** to report weird dads compared to MIT

### Checking Weridness and College relation statistically by a Mosaic Plot

```{r}

vcd::structable(college ~ is_dad_weird, data = dad_weird_mod2) %>%
  vcd::mosaic(shade = TRUE, legend = TRUE,
              main = "College vs Dad Weirdness",
              gp = shading_max)
```

### Observation

-   The **p-value of 0.042** provides **statistically significant evidence** that there is a real difference in dad weirdness perceptions between MIT and SMI students.

-   There appears to be something about the **SMI environment or student demographics** that leads to higher rates of paternal "weirdness" perception compared to the MIT campus culture.

## Conclusion from EDA

This analysis reveals a clear and statistically significant pattern in how students perceive their fathers:

**1. College matters most**

-   **Statistically Significant**: p = 0.042 confirms this is a real pattern, not random chance

-   **Cultural Divide**: Different campus environments appear to shape paternal perception dramatically

**2. Gender doesn't matter**

-   Both male and female students overwhelmingly see dads as normal

**3. Dad approval**

-   73% of students give their fathers a "normal" rating

## Inference

**Null Hypothesis:** There is no difference in dad weirdness perceptions between MIT and SMI students - any observed variation occurs by random chance alone.

### Performing Chi-Square Test

**Creating contingency table & running chi-square test**

```{r}
contingency_table <- table(dad_weird_mod2$college, dad_weird_mod2$is_dad_weird)
xq_test_object <- mosaic::xchisq.test(contingency_table)
```

-   The p-value of 0.0644 indicates **borderline significance** - while not statistically significant at the conventional 0.05 level, it strongly suggests a meaningful pattern where SMI students consistently report more dad weirdness than expected, while MIT students report less.

**Extracting observed chi-square statistic**

```{r}
xq_test_object %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  select(statistic) %>%
  as.numeric() -> X_squared_observed
X_squared_observed
```

**Determining the Chi-Square critical value**

```{r}
X_squared_critical <- qchisq(
  p = .05,
  df = (2 - 1) * (2 - 1), 
  lower.tail = FALSE
)
X_squared_critical
```

-   **Bbserved value**: 3.420189

-   **Critical value**: 3.841459

-   **Decision**: Since 3.42 \< 3.84, your test statistic **does not exceed** the critical threshold

**Visualization for the critical value**

```{r}
ggplot2::theme_set(new = ggplot2::theme_minimal())

mosaic::xqchisq(
  p = 0.95, df = 1,  
  return = c("plot"), verbose = FALSE,
  system = "gg"
) %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Chi-Square Test: College vs Dad Weirdness",
    x = "Chi-Square Value", 
    y = "Density"
  ) %>%
  gf_vline(
    xintercept = X_squared_observed,
    color = "red", linewidth = 1
  ) %>%
  gf_vline(
    xintercept = X_squared_critical,
    color = "dodgerblue",
    linewidth = 1
  ) %>%
  gf_annotate(
    x = X_squared_observed - 1, y = 0.25,
    geom = "label", label = "Observed\nChi-Square",
    fill = "red", alpha = 0.3
  ) %>%
  gf_annotate("curve", 
    x = X_squared_observed - 1, y = 0.23,
    xend = X_squared_observed - 0.1, yend = 0.15,
    linewidth = 0.5, curvature = 0.3,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15, "cm"))
  ) %>%
  gf_annotate(
    x = X_squared_critical + 1, y = 0.25,
    geom = "label", label = "Critical\nChi-Square",
    fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.3
  ) %>%
  gf_annotate("curve", 
    x = X_squared_critical + 1, y = 0.23,
    xend = X_squared_critical + 0.1, yend = 0.15,
    linewidth = 0.5, curvature = -0.3,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15, "cm"))
  )
```

-   Observed chi-square value falls in the **"fail to reject" region** of the distribution, meaning the difference in dad weirdness perceptions between MIT and SMI, while suggestive, is **not statistically significant** at the conventional 0.05 level.

-   The pattern observed (SMI students reporting more dad weirdness) could reasonably occur by random chance about 6.4% of the time (matching the earlier p-value of 0.0644).

## Final interpretation

Despite the popular “cringey dad” stereotype, most students (73%) see their fathers as completely normal. The most interesting difference appears between institutions: although not quite statistically significant (p = 0.064), the 27-point gap between MIT (88%) and SMI (61%) is hard to ignore. The chi-square result (3.42 vs. 3.84) falls just short of the cutoff, but the consistent pattern and effect size suggest something real may be happening, worth exploring further.
