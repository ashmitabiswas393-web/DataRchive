# Believe in God

Real or Myth?

![](images/clipboard-1676803513.png)

## About the Data

This data set explores the spiritual landscape of art students. A quantitative analysis of divine belief patterns at Srishti Manipal Institute.

## Data Dictionary

**Qualitative Variables**

:   **Name:** Name of the student

:   **Gender:** Gender of the student, categorized by 'Male' and 'Female'

:   **Believe_in_God:** Students' believe in God, categorized as 'Yes' and 'No'

## Hypothesis

-   In an art & design educational environment, will students show higher rates of non-belief compared to the general population due to exposure to diverse perspectives and critical thinking emphasis?

**Something more to look for**

-   There might be gender differences in religious belief patterns due potential cultural socialization influences.

### Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false

library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggformula)
library(mosaic)
library(skimr)
library(visdat) 
library(naniar)
library(janitor)
library(tinytable)
library(DT)
library(crosstable)
library(geofacet)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(vcd)
library(vcdExtra)
```

### Inspecting the Data

```{r}

believe_data <- read_csv("~/Documents/R_work/DataRchive/posts/A3_Ashmita/Datasets/5-believe_in_god.csv") %>%
janitor::clean_names(case = "snake")
believe_data
```

### Checking for missing data

```{r}
believe_data %>%
  visdat::vis_miss()
```

```{r}
believe_data %>%
  visdat::vis_dat()
```

There are missing values in the data as some students might have chose to not answer the question. Hence **removing unanswered entries**.

```{r}
believe_mod1 <- believe_data %>% 
  naniar::replace_with_na_all(condition = ~ .x %in% common_na_strings) %>% 
drop_na()
believe_mod1
```

6 entries are dropped from the dataset.

### Munging the Data

Factoring 'gender' and 'believe_in_god'

```{r}
believe_mod2 <- believe_mod1 %>% 
mutate(gender = as.factor(gender),
       believe_in_god = as.factor(believe_in_god))
```

### Counting gender

```{r}
believe_mod2 %>% 
  dplyr::count(gender) %>%
  tt()
```

```{r}
believe_mod2 %>%
  gf_bar(~gender, fill = "gold") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Gender representation",
    x = "Gender",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

#### Observation

-   There is a slight imbalance in the gender proportion, but not very significant.

-   Both genders have substantial representation, though not perfectly equal

### Counting believe_in_god

```{r}
believe_mod2 %>% 
  dplyr::count(believe_in_god) %>%
  tt()
```

```{r}
believe_mod2 %>% 
gf_bar(~believe_in_god, fill = "orange") %>% 
gf_labs(title = "Do students believe in God?",
       x = "Believes in God",
       y = "Count")
```

#### Observation

-   Clearly, majority believe in God vs. not believing.

-   Believers outnumber non-believers by nearly 2 to 1

-   The sample has a slight female majority - could this gender imbalance influence the overall belief distribution?

### Belief by Gender

**Counting Belief by Gender**

```{r}
believe_mod2 %>% 
    count(across(c("gender", "believe_in_god"))) %>%
  tt()
```

**Visualizing in a Dodged Bar graph**

```{r}
believe_mod2 %>%
  gf_bar(~believe_in_god, fill = ~gender, position = "dodge") %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Belief in God by Gender",
    x = "Believes in God",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "Gender"
  )
```

#### Observation

-   There is a strong belief among females where, **18** are believer and **6** are non-believers
-   For males, the belief in nearly split where, **8** are believers and **9** arenon-believers
-   **Gender** seems to be a predictor of religious belief in this student population, with female students nearly twice as likely to believe in God compared to male students.

### Checking the correlation between Gender and Belief with Mosaic Plot

```{r}
vcd::structable(gender ~ believe_in_god, data = believe_mod2) %>%
  vcd::mosaic(shade = TRUE, legend = TRUE,
              main = "Gender vs Belief in God",
              gp = shading_max)
```

#### Observation:

-   Since **p \< 0.05,** there is statistically significant evidence that gender affects belief in God patterns among students

-   Although it is important to note that, p = 0.044 is barely significant (close to the 0.05 threshold) and the relation might be fairly weak.

-   With a smaller sample, this small of a difference might not be significant

## Conclusion from EDA

This analysis reveals two key insights about religious belief among art & design students:

**1. Majority maintains traditional belief**

-   Contrary to the hypothesis, **65% of the students believe in God**, a substantial majority that challenges expectations of higher secularism in creative educational environments.

**2. Significant gender divide**

-   A **pronounced gender gap** exists: **18 female students** believe versus **only 8 of males** - a difference that is statistically significant (p = 0.044), though the relationship is relatively weak.

## Inference

**Null hypothesis:** TThe proportion of students who believe in God is 50% - there is no majority preference in either direction.

Statically, **H₀**: p = 0.5

### Performing Binom Test

```{r}
mosaic::binom.test(~believe_in_god, data = believe_mod2, success = "Yes")
```

```{r}
mosaic::binom.test(~believe_in_god, data = believe_mod2, success = "Yes") %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

### Key Findings

-   The p-value (0.117) indicates we cannot reject the null hypothesis that belief and non-belief are equally distributed (50–50).
-   Observed Belief rate: **63.4%** of art students believe in God
-   Not significant at the **0.05** level (p = 0.117).
-   The true population proportion likely falls between **47% and 78%**

Although a numerical majority (63%) identify as believers, the difference is **not statistically significant**, suggesting that this imbalance could occur by chance in a population with equal proportions of belief and non-belief.

## Final interpretation

Art & Design students **do not show a statistically significant tendency** toward belief or non-belief in God. While the 63% belief rate hints at a potential leaning toward theism, the evidence is insufficient to conclude a meaningful departure from an even 50–50 distribution.
