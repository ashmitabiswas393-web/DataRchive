# Are Tattoos Attractive?

Tattoos or taboos? Analyzing the perception about tattoos.

![](images/clipboard-1622646561.png)

## About the Data

This data set is derived from the peasants of Srishti Manipal Institute to analyse the proportions of non-tattooed people who find tattoos attractive✨.

## Data Dictionary

**Qualitative Variables**

:   **Name:** Name of the student

:   **Gender:** Gender of the student where; M = Male, F = Female

:   **Tattoos_Attractive:** Students' perception about tattoos being attractive or not

## Hypothesis

-   Being in an art and design college, will the proportion of people finding tattoos attractive be more or be equal to those who don't find it attractive?

    **Something interesting to look for:**

-   Does gender play a role in the way tattoos are perceived as?

### Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false

library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggformula)
library(mosaic)
library(skimr)
library(visdat) 
library(naniar)
library(janitor)
library(tinytable)
library(DT)
library(crosstable)
library(geofacet)
library(ggplot2)
library(infer)
library(vcd)
library(vcdExtra)
```

### Inspecting the Data

```{r}

tattoo_data <- read_csv("~/Documents/R_work/DataRchive/posts/A3_Ashmita/Datasets/1-tattoo_attraction.csv") %>% 
janitor::clean_names(case = "snake")
tattoo_data
```

### Checking for missing data

```{r}
tattoo_data %>%
  visdat::vis_miss()
```

Seems like there is no missing data! (Did I already know cause my team collected this data? Hmm)

### Munging the data

```{r}
tattoo_data_mod1 <- tattoo_data %>% 
mutate(gender = as.factor(gender),
tattoo_attractive = as.factor(tattoo_attractive))
```

## Examining the Data

### Taking a glimpse 👀 of the Data

```{r}
glimpse(tattoo_data_mod1)
```

There are a total of *40 entries*

### Counting gender

```{r}
tattoo_data_mod1 %>% 
  dplyr::count(gender) %>%
  tt()
```

#### Observation

-   There is an equal number of male and female representation

### Counting tattoo attractive perception

```{r}
tattoo_data_mod1 %>% 
  dplyr::count(tattoo_attractive) %>% 
  tt()
```

```{r}
tattoo_data_mod1 %>% 
gf_bar(~tattoo_attractive, fill = "navy") %>% 
gf_labs(title = "Do students find tattoos attractive?",
       x = "Are tattoos attractive?",
       y = "Number of students")
```

#### Observation

-   We can see that exactly *75%* of the students find tattoos attractive
-   This maybe due to the influence of the environment where tattoos are looked as a normal mark to have and/or younger generation embracing tattoos.

### Does gender play a role in this?

**Visualizing in a dodge & proportion bar graph**

```{r}
tattoo_data_mod1 %>% 
gf_bar(~tattoo_attractive, fill = ~gender, position = "dodge") %>% 
gf_labs(title = "Tattoo Attractiveness by Gender",
       x = "Are tattoos attractive?",
       y = "Number of students")

```

```{r}
tattoo_data_mod1 %>% 
gf_bar(~tattoo_attractive, fill = ~gender, position = "fill") %>% 
gf_labs(title = "Tattoo Attractiveness by Gender",
       x = "Are tattoos attractive?",
       y = "Number of students")

```

Huh.. it's exactly leveled?

**Verifying through counting**

```{r}
tattoo_data_mod1 %>% 
    count(across(c("gender", "tattoo_attractive"))) %>%
  tt()
```

#### Observation

-   There is an equal distribution amongst the 2 genders with proportional responses mirroring each other.
-   This suggests that there might be no gender bias in the perception of tattoos being attractive, indicating shared cultural values around body art rather than gender-specific preferences

```{r}
vcd::structable(gender ~ tattoo_attractive, data = tattoo_data_mod1) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  addmargins() %>%
  as_tibble(rownames = "gender")

vcd::structable(gender ~ tattoo_attractive, data = tattoo_data_mod1) %>%
  vcd::mosaic(shade = TRUE, legend = TRUE,
              main = "Tattoo Attractiveness by Gender")
```

### Observation

-   The p value = 1 for the relationship between gender and tattoo attractiveness perception

-   This indicates gender and tattoo appeal are statistically independent - tattoo preferences show no gender-based pattern

## Conclusion from EDA

This analysis reveals two key findings about tattoo perceptions among art and design students:

**1. Strong cultural acceptance**

-   **75% of art students** find tattoos attractive, demonstrating significant cultural embrace of body art

-   Suggests **generational and educational shifts** in body art acceptance

**2. Gender-neutral preferences**

-   **Perfect statistical independence** (p = 1.0) between gender and tattoo appeal perceptions

-   Both male and female students show **identical proportional responses**

## Inference

**Null hypothesis:** The proportion of students who find tattoos attractive equals 50%, indicating no majority preference in either direction.

Statically, **H₀**: p = 0.5

### Performing Binom Test

```{r}
mosaic::binom.test(~tattoo_attractive, data = tattoo_data_mod1, success = "Yes")
```

```{r}
mosaic::binom.test(~tattoo_attractive, data = tattoo_data_mod1, success = "Yes") %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

### Key Findings

-   The binomial test provides **strong evidence** (p = 0.0022) that the 75% tattoo attractiveness rate is **not due to random chance**.

-   We can **reject the null hypothesis** of 50-50 distribution (since p \< 0.05)

-   **True population proportion** likely falls between 59-87% (which strangles 95% CI)

## Final interpretation

Srishti students demonstrate **significantly positive attitudes** toward tattoos, with 75% finding them attractive, a preference strongly supported by statistical evidence (p = 0.002). This substantial majority indicates that tattoo appeal is widely embraced within the art school environment with a universal appeal across genders, reflecting strong cultural acceptance rather than neutral or divided opinions
